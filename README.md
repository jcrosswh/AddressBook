Angular Address Book
=======================

Introduction
------------
This application was written as an experiment to see how to use both PHP as
a REST service and Angular as a front end application.  The application is a
simple rolodex application - manage contacts through creation of new ones,
listing existing ones, and editing or deleting existing contacts.
